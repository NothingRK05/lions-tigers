Thank you to Brad Schiff for providing the HTML, CSS, and js code with your tutorial ->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmGmLFcukM&t=0s

instructions to compile and execute:
Im not really sure how to explain how to compile and execute the application. 
I followed the tutorial by Brad Schiff to code and run everything, then I followed Eric Pogue's example during class to set up azure. After I completed Eric Pogues video(https://www.lewisuniversity.org/activity-config/deploying-node-js-to-azure-2022), I was able to launch my website onto azure using VScode, file explorer, and git commands(git clone,add,commit,push).
